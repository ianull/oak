# TensorFlow Lite for Microcontroller (TLFM) on Oak

## File and Directory Structure

```text
cc/tflite_micro
|-- generated
|   A clean set of tflm sources generated by:
|   `python3 tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/project_generation/create_tflm_tree.py generated`
|   Generated sources have a slightly different file/header structure and cut ~50%
|   sources to be compiled, which also implies less external dependency errors to fix on
|   in a bare-metal and freestanding binary development environment.
|
|   To upgrade/downgrade tflm, simply regenerate its sources and replace the `generated`
|   folder completely.
|
|-- oak
|   |-- apps
|   |   All tflite model apps are put under this folder.
|   |   |-- hello_world
|   |   |   hello_world tflite model app.
|   |   |-- BUILD
|   |   |   Provide common dependencies shared by all tflite model apps.
|   |   |-- start.S
|   |   |   Used by tflite model apps to generate freestanding and executable binary
|   |   |   to run on PC.
|   |
|   |-- include
|   |   Provide Oak-specific declarations to tflite model apps.
|   |
|   |-- libc
|   |   A pico libc linked by tflm and only required apis are implemented.
|   |   bsearch and optimized (by SIMD instruction set i.e. SSE2/SSSE3/SSE4/AVX2) string apis
|   |   are sourced and modified from Android bionic libc*.
|   |   misc.cc implements apis required by tflm and releated/specific to Oak trusted execution environment.
|   |   Other sources are sourced from Google nanolibc**, which currently misses bsearch,
|   |   string-to-{float|double} and most apis are implemented in an non-optimized way for
|   |   better portability.
|   |
|   |-- libgcc
|   |   A pico libgcc implements clrsb GCC builtin function required by tflm.
|   |
|   |-- libm
|   |   A pico libm implements a set of complementary math apis required by tflm.
|   |   To build freestanding model app binary, compiler links static libm by default (-lm).
|   |   To build Oak freestanding model app binary compiled and linked with Oak Restricted Kernel
|   |   and Oak TensorFlow Service, this is a complement to libm.rs that Oak Restricted Kernel implements.
|   |
|   |-- BUILD
|   |   Provide Oak-specific build options and shared header/source targets.
|   |
|   |-- build_defs.bzl
|   |   Provide Oak-specific compiler options, linker options and tool macros.
|   |
|   |-- debug_log.cc
|   |   Implement Oak-specific debug logging required by tflm micro-printf.
|
|-- tools
|   |-- BUILD
|   |
|   |-- generate_cc_arrays.py
|   |   Convert a tflite model to a static C array and generate corresponding header and
|   |   source files which can be specified in cc_binary/cc_library rules. Sourced and
|   |   modified from tflm's <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/blob/main/tensorflow/lite/micro/tools/generate_cc_arrays.py">generate_cc_arrays.py</a>.
|
|-- BUILD
|   Provide a build target for generated tflm sources to avoid adding any changes to the
|   generated folder.

## Build Model Binaries

There are two sorts of freestanding binaries, using hello_world model app as
example:

1. Build the binary that runs on PC

   ```bash
   bazel build //cc/tflite_micro/oak/apps/hello_world:hello_world_bin
   ```

   The binary is built with -nostdlib which removes dependencies of standard
   libraries i.e. libc, libgcc, etc to ensure a freestanding binary is generated
   and can run on PC. The binary is good for tflite model porting, debugging and
   tensor activation validating. Its freestanding nature makes it a good fit of
   validating execution on TEE.

1. Binaries that runs on Oak server
   ```bash
   cd oak_tensorflow_freestanding_bin
   cargo build
   ```
   The binary is built with Oak Restricted Kernel and Oak TensorFlow Service,
   which can be loaded into virtual machine for execution under TEE.

### Additional Build Options

There are few optional build options provided:

- `--define=no_opt=1`\
   Disable compiler optimizations when building model app freestanding binaries.

- `--define=no_sse=1`\
   Disable using streaming SIMD instructions i.e. SSE2/SSSE3/SSE4/AVX2. The
  option under the hook would use non-optimized nanolibc string apis i.e.
  str{len|cmp|cpy|...}, mem{cpy|cmp|move|set|...}, etc. Additinally, tflite is
  built without `-msse4.2`.

- `--define=use_custom_output=1`\
   To build tflm without using Oak debug_log.cc; instead, using a custom
  debug_log.cc for multiple use cases i.e. testing, ported to other operating
  systems that implement proprietary debug logging, etc.

## Debugging Model Binaries

As what aforementioned, we are able to build freestanding libraries that can run
on PC. In order for debugger i.e. gdb/lldb to correctly work on the binaries, we
need to specify additional bulid parameters telling bazel to keep all debug
symbols and optionally disabling optimizations so breakpoints can be precisely
mapped to correct lines of source code.

Use hell_world model app as example,

```bash
bazel build --copt=-g --strip=never --define=no_opt=1 //cc/tflite_micro/oak/apps/hello_world:hello_world_bin
```

`--define=no_opt=1` is optional if correct source mapping is not needed.

Next, configure i.e. lldb for VS Code,\
.vscode/launch.json

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "lldb",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Debug",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/bazel-bin/cc/tflite_micro/oak/apps/hello_world/hello_world_freestanding_bin",
      "args": [],
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "sourceMap": {
        "/proc/self/cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

As bazel replaces the actual source location with `/proc/self/cwd` to achieve
repeatable builds, it is required to add the mapping
`"/proc/self/cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"`.

After applying the configuration, you are good to go to set breakpoints in
sources, watch memroy contents, online memory/register manipulations and so
forth.
